ABOUT NANOSAUR™ EXTREME

Nanosaur Extreme is a modified version of Nanosaur.  The game is exactly the same, but there are about 5x as many enemies and weapons.  Basically, it's Nanosaur on steroids.    For example, in the normal version of Nanosaur, only 2 T-Rex dino's will appear at any given time.  In Nanosaur Extreme, however, up to 10 T-Rexes can attack at the same time.  Also, the visible area of the scene has been extended, so that you can see farther into the distance.

This version is extremelly difficult and also requires much more horsepower than the original version:

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- 350mhz or better
- ATI Rage 128 3D acceleration
- 96 MB RAM

Note, however, that the game will still play with a slower processor and 3D card, and it will probably still work in only 64MB of RAM, but for the best experience, we recommend the above minimums.
